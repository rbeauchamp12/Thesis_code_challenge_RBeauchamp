Thesis code challenge

for this challenge I used pure HTML3 and CSS3. I was able to use responsive design with a custom grid system which allows for pleasant viewing on all screen sizes.
I also added an animated hambuger icon with a modern twist with a nice green accent colors. 
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask.

thank you for the challenge.
